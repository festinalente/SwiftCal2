* calendarGenerator.js (preloadDates): Added a function that allows an array of preloaded dates to be added to the calendar (e.g. for availability on certain dates, of a certain bookable service). This function will in theory mean "end user" functionality doesn't have to be added, as it's implicit. 

* CHANGELOG.md: Added a change log.
